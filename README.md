## Description

Fork of the [@nestjs/swagger@3.1.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nestjs/swagger/v/3.1.0) package for [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest).
The fork was done mainly to run all old swagger Nest APIs done with `@nestjs/swagger` <= 3.1.0 on current Nest versions (>= 10).
There are no functionality updates planned at this stage.
New APIs should probably be started using the latest official `@nestjs/swagger` version.
